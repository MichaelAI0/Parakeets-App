# ParaKeets App

## Introduction

Hi, I'm MichaelAI0, a junior developer looking to gain experience and improve my skills. This project is one of my first attempts to create something on my own and learn more about using the Rails api for my Angular application.

## Purpose

I wanted to create something that would challenge me and help me develop my skills as a developer. While also highlighting my interest for web design and innovative web apps.

## Technology Used

This project was built using Angular/Typescript frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend. I chose these technologies because I wanted to gain experience with them and learn more about how they work.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Contributions

As a junior developer, I'm always looking for feedback and ways to improve my skills. If you have any suggestions or improvements for this project, please feel free to fork off of the project.

## Contact
